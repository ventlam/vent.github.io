- You will not present any false, inaccurate or misleading information in an effort to misrepresent your location or place of residence, and you will not attempt to circumvent any restrictions on access to or availability of the Subscription Services or content available within the Subscription Services.

**2. Payments and Billing.**

_2.1 General._

_Fees_. All fees and charges will be described to you when you sign-up for a Subscription Service. You agree to pay the price stated at the time of purchase, as well as any applicable taxes. You also agree to the billing frequency as stated at the time of purchase.

_Taxes_. If ChatOnce is required to collect or pay any taxes in connection with your purchase of a Subscription, such taxes will be charged to you at the time of each purchase transaction or other appropriate time as applicable. The Subscription fees will not include Value Added Tax (“VAT”) or Goods & Services Tax (“GST”). If you subscribed via a third party, such as Apple or GooglePlay, taxes, including VAT or GST, may be collected upon purchase. Additionally, if required by law, you are responsible for reporting and paying certain taxes in connection with your purchase and use of Subscriptions. Such taxes may include duties, customs fees, or other taxes (other than income tax), along with any related penalties or interest, as applicable to your purchase or country of purchase.

_Payment Methods_. In order to purchase for a Subscription Service, you must provide account information for at least one valid debit or credit card or other payment method through or to the ChatOnce Platform. You may receive a temporary authorization charge to validate your payment method. ChatOnce uses this payment method account information as described in our [_privacy policy_](https://www.draftai.ai/privacy). If you subscribed via a third party, such as Apple or GooglePlay, your provision of such debit or credit card shall be subject to the terms and conditions specified by such third party. Accepted payment methods may vary based on your location. ChatOnce takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any actions or omissions of such third party.

You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use any payment method used by you in connection with any Subscription.

_Payment Processors_. ChatOnce works with third-party service providers to perform payment processing, including card processing and currency exchange (“Payment Agent”). Any payment processing will be subject to the terms and privacy policy of the Payment Agent. ChatOnce may share transaction information (namely, the amount of payment due) with our Payment Agent, but not credit card information, which you provide to the Payment Agent directly and not to ChatOnce.

_Currencies_. All prices are in United States Dollars or another currency specified by ChatOnce at the time of purchase. The currency used to charge you for Subscription payments depends on the billing country where your payment method is located. You agree to and acknowledge that ChatOnce cannot control any currency conversion or foreign transaction fees that may be charged to you by your card issuer or bank for your Subscription payment.

_Restricted Countries_. There may be countries that restrict or prohibit your ability to make payments through the ChatOnce Platform or third-parties, such as Apple or GooglePlay. Nothing in these Subscriber Terms should be interpreted to override or circumvent any such foreign laws.

_Unauthorized Charges_. Without limitation of the above terms, if you believe that a problematic transaction has taken place under your account, you agree to notify us immediately, so that we may take action to prevent financial loss.

_Data Charges_. When you use your Subscription, you may incur other additional charges from third party service providers, such as telecommunications fees or data fees. You are responsible for paying any additional charges.

_2.2 Recurring Charges and Refunds._

_Recurring Charges_. If you purchase an annual or monthly Subscription, you authorize ChatOnce to charge you the annual or monthly Subscription fee as selected by you in the course of the transaction at purchase and each year or month thereafter on the annual or monthly anniversary of the start of your Subscription, respectively, using the payment method you provided at the then-current rate.

You acknowledge that a Subscription has recurring payment features. You accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Subscription. Your Subscription continues until canceled by you in the manner set forth in _Section 2.5_ below or until we terminate your access to, or use of, a Subscription in accordance with these Subscriber Terms.

_Refunds_. All Subscription fees or other final charges are non-refundable, other than as determined by ChatOnce. If you subscribed via a third party, such as Apple or GooglePlay, please contact such service to understand their refund policies.

_Third Party Purchases_. Subscriptions and other purchases through a third party (e.g., Google Play, iOS or PayPal) are managed directly by the applicable third party. You should consult with the appropriate third party to determine if the price charged includes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. Those third parties collect one-time and subscription fees, manage the subscription, and report to us on the status of subscription accounts that have been purchased from them. We do not have the ability to initiate, cancel, or refund such a third-party subscription on your behalf, but we do have the ability to make changes to your subscription entitlements in connection with such third-party subscriptions (for example, by turning off your entitlement to a subscription if you canceled it through a third-party).

2.3 _Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans._

We may change our subscription plans and the price of our Subscription Services from time to time; however, any price changes or changes to your subscription plans will apply no earlier than 30 days following notice to you. If you do not wish to accept the price change or change to your subscription plan, you can cancel your subscription before the change takes effect.

_2.4 Free Trials and Promotional Codes._

ChatOnce may offer free trial Subscriptions for a specified period (“Free Trials”). If we offer you a Free Trial, specific terms will be provided at signup or any promotional materials. Unless you cancel your Subscription prior to its end, we will begin charging your payment method after the Free Trial for the applicable monthly or annual recurring Subscription fees selected by you as described in _Section 2.1_ above. You can cancel your Free Trial or Subscription at any time as described in _Section 2.5_ below. Limit one Free Trial per person.

ChatOnce may offer promotional codes from time to time. Promotional codes will expire on the date provided in any promotional materials. Only one promotional code may be redeemed per account during each promotion. Promotional codes are not transferable and are not redeemable for cash.

_2.5 Cancellation and Termination._

You may cancel a Subscription, including Free Trials, through your account settings at any time. The cancellation will take effect at the end of the Free Trial or the current billing cycle (the “Cancellation Effective Date”). You are responsible for all Subscription fees (plus any applicable taxes or charges) incurred before the Cancellation Effective Date. You will have access to Subscription Content until the Cancellation Effective Date.

ChatOnce may terminate your Subscription for non-payment of Subscription fees or violating these Subscriber Terms or Terms of Service. If ChatOnce terminates your Subscription, your cancellation will be effective immediately, and you will not be able to access Subscription Content.

In the event of any Subscription cancellation, these Subscriber Terms will terminate, the Terms of Service will survive and continue to apply to your use of the ChatOnce Platform. _Sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6_ survive the expiration or termination of these Subscriber Terms.

In the event you purchase a Subscription through a third party (e.g., Apple or Google), such Subscriptions, billing and cancellation are managed directly by the applicable third party. You can manage subscriptions purchased via Apple on your Apple mobile device, by visiting the Settings App on your device, selecting your Apple ID and then Subscriptions. You can manage subscriptions purchased via Google by visiting the Google Play Store.

Your continued use of a Subscription after non-material changes, or after reasonable notice to you of any material changes to the Subscriber Terms, constitutes acceptance of those changes.
